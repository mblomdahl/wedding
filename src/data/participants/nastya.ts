  description: "Welcome, Nastya and Family!\n\nWe are so thrilled to welcome my dear sister Nastya, her husband Kostya, and their wonderful children Vika and Sema to our wedding!\n\nNastya and I share the same father but have different mothers, and though we didn't grow up in the same household, her presence in my adult life has been truly transformative. Nastya has inspired me in countless ways, particularly through the beautiful family she and Kostya have built together since their youth. Their love and commitment, raising their teenage daughter Vika and their lively 9-year-old son Sema, are a testament to the strength of their bond.\n\nNot only has Nastya had a profound impact on my personal life, but she's also been a positive influence on so many others. As a professional nutritionist with years of experience, she's dedicated to promoting a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Because of her guidance and expertise, I feel confident that my own family will enjoy nutritious and wholesome food, grow stronger, and live happier lives. For that, Nastya, we are endlessly grateful.",
